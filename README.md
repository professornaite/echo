## ECHO: Education, Community, and Health Outcomes Project

The ECHO project seeks to develop a database that integrates often siloed data in education and connect it community-level indicators (via US census data) and health outcomes data with a focus on public health research and frameworks. This includes inequality metrics commonly used in social sciences.
